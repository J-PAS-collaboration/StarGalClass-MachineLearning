# The miniJPAS survey: star-galaxy classiﬁcation using machine learning

We make available the Machine Learning models developed in the paper [The miniJPAS survey: star-galaxy classiﬁcation using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07622). These models are relative to the XMATCH catalog, which spans the magnitude range 15 ≤ r ≤ 23.5 and features a total of 11763 sources, 9517 galaxies and 2246 stars. The best models (RF without morphology and ERT with morphology) were applied to the 29551 miniJPAS sources in the magnitude range 15 ≤ r ≤ 23.5. The corresponding Value Added Catalog is publicly available at [j-pas.org/datareleases](https://j-pas.org/datareleases) via the ADQL table minijpas.StarGalClass. See the paper for more details.

If using any parts of these codes, please acknowledge the authors and cite the companion paper [The miniJPAS survey: star-galaxy classiﬁcation using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07622) and the presentation paper [The miniJPAS survey: a preview of the Universe in 56 colours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01910).
